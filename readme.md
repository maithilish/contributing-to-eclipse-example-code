# Chapter 26 - Contributing to Eclipse

## Installation

For installation of the example code in Eclipse IDE see <a href="https://www.codetab.org/post/contributing-to-eclipse/">Contributing to Eclipse Installation</a>. If you have already done this then no further installation is required. Now on, you have to do only the chapter wise checkout and setup. 

## Setup

You are here after switching the branch with `git checkout chapter-26`. Next, select all the plugin projects in Project Explorer and refresh with F5.

## Run

The chapter 26 integrates 'Contributed Test Report' and 'Contributed Result View' views with Java Perspective.

So far, these two views were available under 'Other' category and by default, they used to open beside Problems, Console etc., With the modification, they appear under Java category and also as shortcuts in the Show View option. When opened they are stacked below the Problems view. 

Run the plugin using Run As -> Eclipse Application. In runtime workbench, switch to Java perspective and reset the perspective. Go to Window -> Show View, the two contributed views are now shown as shortcuts. They also appear under Other -> Java. Next, open these two views, and they appear below the Problems View.
