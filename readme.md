# Contributing to Eclipse

The example code used in the book, **The Contributing to Eclipse: Principles, Patterns, and Plug-Ins by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma**, fails to run in the latest Eclipse. This repo contains refactored code that runs on Eclipse 3 and 4 platforms.

For installation of the example code in Eclipse IDE see <a href="https://www.codetab.org/post/contributing-to-eclipse/">Contributing to Eclipse Installation</a>.
