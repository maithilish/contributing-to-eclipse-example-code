# Chapter 14 - Contributing to Eclipse 

## Installation

For installation of the example code in Eclipse IDE see <a href="https://www.codetab.org/post/contributing-to-eclipse/">Contributing to Eclipse Installation</a>. If you have already done this then no further installation is required. Now on, you have to do only the chapter wise checkout and setup. 

## Setup

You are here after switching branch with `git checkout chapter-14`. Next, select all the plugin projects in Project Explorer and refresh with F5.

## Run

Run plugins as Eclipse Application (Run As -> Eclipse Application) and in runtime workbench open 'Contributed Result View' with Window -> Show View -> Other -> Other -> Contributed Result View.

Right click anywhere in the view and in popup menu two menus - Re-run and Contributed Item - are shown. Click on Re-run, and it outputs a log message 'rerun' to host IDE console. Click on Contributed Item opens a information dialog 'The chosen operation is not currently available'.
