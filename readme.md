# Chapter 17 - Contributing to Eclipse 

## Installation

For installation of the example code in Eclipse IDE see <a href="https://www.codetab.org/post/contributing-to-eclipse/">Contributing to Eclipse Installation</a>. If you have already done this then no further installation is required. Now on, you have to do only the chapter wise checkout and setup. 

## Setup

You are here after switching branch with `git checkout chapter-17`. Next, select all the plugin projects in Project Explorer and refresh with F5.

## Run

The Chapter 17 adds TestSearcher and a test class SearchTest.

Run eclipse.contribution.junit.test.SearchTest.java and test should pass. Instead, you can run all the test created so far by selecting org.eclipse.contribution.junit.test package and Run As -> JUnit Plug-in Test and all tests should pass.
